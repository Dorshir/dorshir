I think there is a problem with the changing state of the "should i wait ot immidietly seat".
Inisde the if statment, the point where we use mutex.signal() and then block.wait(), but we didnt update the state of the variables 
other threads depends on to make decisiions, which can accure a situation where more than 5 threads are eating.. 
But im not sure... having hard time finding the correct issue
